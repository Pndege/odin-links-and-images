<!-- href attribute is used to for giving links more information or a reference to information -->
 <!-- <a> stands for anchor tag and is used to give text a hyperlink visual however provides no information or does nothing when clicked (appears as normal text when generated without href attribute)-->
    <!-- "target" attribute is used when one wants to open the hyperlink in another tab, the default is usually "_blank" though it depends on your browser settings-->
     <!-- "rel" attribute is used to explain the relation between the current page and linked document -->
      <!-- noopener value is used to deny the opened link access to the original source where it was opened/clicked -->
       <!-- noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing anywhere where that link exists -->
        <!-- In this project i used a absolute link which leads to a another website -->
         <!-- <img> is used to display images on a website it is also a void element which means it contains no content -->
          <!-- "src" is used similarly to href in which it embeds the images using relative paths & Absolute paths-->
           <!-- "alt" attribute is used to describe an image for example for screen readers who are visually impaired -->
